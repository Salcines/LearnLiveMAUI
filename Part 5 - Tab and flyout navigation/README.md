# Create multi-page apps with tab and flyout navigation

In this module will make a multi-page app that will use three navigation types:

1. Use a mixed flyout menu and tabbed to direct navigation between pages
1. Use a stack navigation navigate forward and backward

We add the all pages screenshots next:
